"The most excellent and sophisticated analysis" ~ Dr. Zoran Djordjevic



Dear LinkedIn Community, I hope this post finds you well! As this semester comes to a close, I am thrilled to share my term project for Advanced Machine Learning.



Throughout the past few months, I've had the privilege of diving into the intricate world of machine learning, culminating in an ambitious project that I am thrilled to share with you all. ü§ñ üîç



Project Spotlight: Deep Neural Network-based Q-Agent Learning for Understanding Stock Behavior



For the last couple of months, I delved into the fascinating domain of reinforcement learning and its application in understanding a stock's behavior via Reinforcement learning, a paradigm inspired by behavioral psychology, that is at the heart of creating intelligent agents that can make optimal decisions in complex environments.



To break it down a bit, I explored the concept of Q-learning, a subset of reinforcement learning that focuses on training agents to make sequential decisions to maximize long-term rewards. It's like teaching a model to play chess, but instead of moves, it's predicting the given stock's behavior. üïπÔ∏è 



The highlight of my journey was witnessing the tangible results of my project. Using a Deep Neural Network-based Q-agent, I achieved a staggering 189.5% returns in predicting the behavior of Apple Inc. stocks (AAPL). I believe, Understanding the behavior of stocks is crucial for investors, and leveraging advanced machine learning techniques can provide invaluable insights. 



I want to express my gratitude to my professor Dr. Zoran Djordjevic, mentors, peers, and the entire community for the support and encouragement throughout this journey. I would also like to thank Dr Ashwin Rao and Tikhon Jelvis for their wonderful book "Foundations of Reinforcement Learning and its Applications in Finance". Learning is a collaborative process, and I am grateful to be part of a community that fosters innovation and growth. As one chapter closes, another one begins. I am eager to carry this momentum into future projects and continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of machine learning. Thank you for being a part of this incredible journey! #MachineLearning #ReinforcementLearning #StockPrediction #AI #DeepLearning #QAgent #ResultsMatter üöÄ
